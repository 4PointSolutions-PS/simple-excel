# Simple Excel Library

### Introduction
This is a simple library that can be used to read and write data from/to Excel files.  It is intended to provide
a simplified interface over the [Apache POI libraries](https://poi.apache.org/).  The interface is simplified
by excluding the formatting functionality from the interface.

If you are just looking to easily and simply read data from an Excel spreadsheet, this is a good choice.
